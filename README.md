# Pomodoro Timer

## Overview

This is a simple Pomodoro timer application built in Python. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This application helps users implement the Pomodoro Technique by providing a customizable timer with adjustable work and break intervals.

## Features

- Timer with fixed durations for work and break periods.
- Start and reset the timer.
- After completing 4 Pomodoro sessions, a longer break period is initiated.
